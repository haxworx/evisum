Evisum - System Monitor.

This is a process and system monitor for Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and
DragonFlyBSD. It is server-client based and includes rudimentary tools for
process, CPU, memory, storage and sensor querying. The current set of
features aims to reach a common denominator between the three popular and
viable Unix-like operating systems at this time: Linux, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

REQUIREMENTS:

An installation of EFL (v1.19.0+). Remember to set your PKG_CONFIG_PATH
environment variable accordingly. For example if EFL is installed in /opt:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/libdata/pkgconfig"

BUILD:

$ meson build

$ ninja -C build

INSTALL:

$ ninja -C build install

CONTRIBUTIONS:

Patches with bug fixes are more than welcome. If you do wish to add a
substantial querying feature PLEASE ensure that it works reliaibly on OpenBSD,
Linux and FreeBSD.
