System Monitor (EFL)

This is a process monitor and system monitor for Linux, OpenBSD
FreeBSD, DragonFlyBSD and macOS.

REQUIREMENTS:

An installation of EFL (v1.19.0+). Remember to set your
PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable accordingly. For example
if EFL is installed in /opt:

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/opt/libdata/pkgconfig"

BUILD:

$ meson build

$ ninja -C build

INSTALL:

$ ninja -C build install

CONTRIBUTIONS:

Patches with bug fixes are more than welcome. If you do wish to
add a substantial querying feature PLEASE ensure that it works reliaibly
on OpenBSD, Linux and FreeBSD (ideally macOS also). UI changes
should be platform independent.
