There are none :)

* Some input devices (touchpads) will send far too many events
  which the scroller respects and that is extremely intensive
  for the genlist of the process explorer. Fix is either in EFL
  or configure scrolling behaviour for the device.

* Alignment of some items. Please, for now, find an optimum width
  manually, which the program will remember on all future runs.
  Theme constraints (and i'd like to support others than default),
  and the ability to select various fields means this is a necessity
  for now until...who knows...

* Memory calculations. These ARE accurate AFAIU, but they are not
  standard practice of all items aggregated as with other tools.

* Other issues are possibly OS bugs. FreeBSD, for example, depending
  on the query will list two different times for process CPU time.
  Some inclusive of interrupts and others exclusive. Not a bug.

* If you are writing an EFL application...copy my practice at your own
  risk!!!
