Memory:

Something pretty for memory usage over time. Work in progress might need to
comment out the code for release.

CPU:

Something for 16 cores+ I have some ideas. Anything pretty. Suggestions.

Process List:

Maybe the genlist/buttons widget can be a widget with other features also.
Some issue with scrolling CPU after some time. Not the cache.

Engine:

Have one process polling and writing to disk and mapping to memory some IPC
for real-time stats for a UI.

BUGS:

Fix minor leak on exit when setting custom format on progressbar free callback.
Issue is cache related and abusing genlist related.
