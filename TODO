Memory:

Something pretty for memory usage over time. Work in progress might need to
comment out the code for release.

CPU:

Something for 16 cores+ I have some ideas. Anything pretty. Suggestions.

Process List:

Maybe the genlist/buttons widget can be a widget with other features also.
Some issue with scrolling CPU after some time. Not the cache.

Process View:

Some stats over time visually (pretty). Fix the keyboard focus tree.
Add some stats, process CPU time etc. Needs plugged in.
This whole UI bit can be much simpler and better.  Cool to check a process
in the list and pop up some live informative stats...

ICONz:

A flat icon. ApBBB's original icon is better than I currently can do but it's
not quite right.

Engine:

Have one process polling and writing to disk and mapping to memory some IPC
for real-time stats for a UI.
