=============

  * Fix a bug ?

============
Evisum 0.5.9
============

  * Search "dialogue" added to process list.
  * Remember window sizing and location.
  * Simplify the process list view. One job, processes. Memory, CPU
    and other stats have their own windows.
  * Introduce the menu to other windows. No feature takes
    presedence (potentially).
  * Improved keyboard support. PgUp/PgDown focus. All windows
    close on Escape. You can quickly check some stat then close it.
  * Rewrite the sensors UI. Some OS don't cache when reading
    sensors. It makes better use of screen also.
  * Add a basic indicator for power supply.
  * Improve behaviour on OpenBSD amd64 and arm64.
  * Remove lots of horrible code.
  * Fix bug (CPU).
  * Purge an overly complicated storage API.

    irrelevant to the title of the commit. :)

  * Add kernel threads to the options.

  * Some photographs of skies (thanks raster).
  * Some animation, images and icons.
  * Add a mascot (Harvey my Australian dog).
  * Fix rare crash.
  * UI changes...
  * Other small fixes undocumented.
  * No more macOS features or changes as they are locking
    down their eco-system...things change all the time with
    zero documentation and to access various OS sub-systems
    you are required signing certicates and your name in blood...

    Not really a fan of Darwinisms, more into string theory...
